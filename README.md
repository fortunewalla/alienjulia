Aim: To learn about the intricacies of the Julia programming language through writing a book.

Introduction: This book is a way to explore how to code effectively and efficiently in Julia. It is mainly meant for beginners. This book will keep evolving as new concepts in Julia are introduced.

Plan: We will use the latest nightly builds and a text editor. This is done to simplify the development experience and focus as much as possible on learning. Expect only weekly updates as of now.
